  "body": "### **Introduction**\r\nPredicting sales performance is one of the key challenges every business face. It is important for firms to predict customer demands to offer the right product at the right time and at the right place. The importance of this issue is underlined by the fact that figuratively a bazillion consulting firms are on the market trying to offer sales forecasting services to businesses of all sizes. Some of these firms rely on advanced data analytics techniques, the kind of which we will be covering in CS-109 classes.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n[Rossmann](http://www.rossmann.pl) is the largest drugstore in Germany. Moreover, it operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. In 2015, [Rossmann](http://www.rossmann.pl) store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.\r\n\r\n#### Kaggle\r\nIn their [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales), [Rossmann](http://www.rossmann.pl) challenged Kagglers to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. Our team has been working on this project consists of: [Hong Zhu](https://github.com/zhu2548972), [Zhihao Lin](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhihao-lin-16033213), [Weiyi Chen](https://github.com/weiyialanchen), [Zona Kostic (TF)](https://github.com/zonakostic). The project is based on data given by this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).\r\n\r\n### **Data**\r\nThe original dataset provided on Kaggle consists of the following variables.\r\n\r\n|     Train     \t|           Store           \t|      Test     \t|\r\n|:-------------:\t|:-------------------------:\t|:-------------:\t|\r\n|     Store     \t|           Store           \t|       Id      \t|\r\n|   DayOfWeek   \t|         StoreType         \t|     Store     \t|\r\n|     Sales     \t|         Assortment        \t|   DayOfWeek   \t|\r\n|   Customers   \t|    CompetitionDistance    \t|      Date     \t|\r\n|      Open     \t| CompetitionOpenSinceMonth \t|      Open     \t|\r\n|     Promo     \t|           Promo2          \t|     Promo     \t|\r\n|  StateHoliday \t|      Promo2SinceWeek      \t|  StateHoliday \t|\r\n| SchoolHoliday \t|      Promo2SinceYear      \t| SchoolHoliday \t|\r\n|               \t|       PromoInternal       \t|               \t|\r\n\r\nThree data sets were provided. As usual, a train and test data set were provided. An additional data set for Store data was also provided. The variable names are quite self-explanatory. The following are descriptions for those that aren't.\r\n\r\n* StoreType - differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d\r\n* Assortment - describes an assortment level: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended\r\n* Promo2 - Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating\r\n\r\n### **Literature Study**\r\nBy running through the data science process we will be able to answer the following research questions:\r\n\r\n* To what extend is sales performance influenced by factors like: promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.\r\n* What is an appropriate model to predict sales?\r\n \r\nGoing through resources for background on the project, we summarized the following results from top performance models.\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.

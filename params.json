  "body": "### **Introduction**\r\nPredicting sales performance is one of the key challenges every business face. It is important for firms to predict customer demands to offer the right product at the right time and at the right place. The importance of this issue is underlined by the fact that figuratively a bazillion consulting firms are on the market trying to offer sales forecasting services to businesses of all sizes. Some of these firms rely on advanced data analytics techniques, the kind of which we will be covering in CS-109 classes.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n[Rossmann](http://www.rossmann.pl) is the largest drugstore in Germany. Moreover, it operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. In 2015, [Rossmann](http://www.rossmann.pl) store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.\r\n\r\n#### Kaggle\r\nIn their [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales), [Rossmann](http://www.rossmann.pl) challenged Kagglers to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. Our team has been working on this project consists of: [Hong Zhu](https://github.com/zhu2548972), [Zhihao Lin](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhihao-lin-16033213), [Weiyi Chen](https://github.com/weiyialanchen), [Zona Kostic (TF)](https://github.com/zonakostic). The project is based on data given by this Kaggle competition.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?

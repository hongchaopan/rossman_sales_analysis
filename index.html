</h3>

<p>Predicting sales performance is one of the key challenges every business face. It is important for firms to predict customer demands to offer the right product at the right time and at the right place. The importance of this issue is underlined by the fact that figuratively a bazillion consulting firms are on the market trying to offer sales forecasting services to businesses of all sizes. Some of these firms rely on advanced data analytics techniques, the kind of which we will be covering in CS-109 classes.</p>

<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.rossmann.pl">Rossmann</a> is the largest drugstore in Germany. Moreover, it operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. In 2015, <a href="http://www.rossmann.pl">Rossmann</a> store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.</p>

<h4>
<a id="kaggle" class="anchor" href="#kaggle" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kaggle</h4>

<p>In their <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales">Kaggle competition</a>, <a href="http://www.rossmann.pl">Rossmann</a> challenged Kagglers to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. Our team has been working on this project consists of: <a href="https://github.com/zhu2548972">Hong Zhu</a>, <a href="https://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhihao-lin-16033213">Zhihao Lin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/weiyialanchen">Weiyi Chen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zonakostic">Zona Kostic (TF)</a>. The project is based on data given by this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales">Kaggle competition</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h3>

<p>Three data sets were provided. As usual, a train and test data set were provided. An additional data set for Store data was also provided. The variable names are quite self-explanatory. The following are descriptions for those that aren't.</p>

<ul>
<li>StoreType - differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d</li>
<li>Assortment - describes an assortment level: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended</li>
<li>Promo2 - Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
